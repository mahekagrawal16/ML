# Machine Learning Projects: Movie Recommendation System & Spam Mail Detection
This repository includes two machine learning projects demonstrating real-world applications of classification and recommendation systems using Python and Scikit-learn.

ðŸ“© Spam Mail Detection using Machine Learning

A binary classification model that identifies whether an email is spam or legitimate (ham). The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and logistic regression for effective text classification.
Performed text preprocessing including lowercasing, punctuation removal, and token normalization.
Applied TF-IDF vectorization to transform email content into numerical features.
Trained a logistic regression classifier achieving high accuracy on both training and test sets.
Supports predictions on real-time, unseen input messages.
Model and vectorizer are serialized using Joblib for deployment.

ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

A content-based recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on a user-provided movie title. Built using metadata and natural language descriptions of movies.
Utilized TF-IDF to vectorize movie overviews.
Employed cosine similarity to compute relevance scores between movies.
Provides top-N recommendations based on semantic similarity.
Demonstrates scalable and interpretable recommendation logic.
